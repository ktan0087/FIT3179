                    issues globally, alongside smoking and high blood pressure, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular
                    diseases.
                    What are the factors that contribute to air pollution?

                    We can see that the most polluted countries are in <b class="bolded2">Asia and Africa</b>. Air pollution is more
                    prevalent in poor and middle-income countries for two basic reasons. First, because they rely on solid fuels for
                    cooking, low-income countries frequently have high levels of indoor pollution. Second, when countries industrialise
                    and move from low to medium income status, outdoor air pollution tends to rise.

                    There is no clear correlation between a country's <b class="bolded2">GDP per capita</b> and its pollution levels. While some rapidly
                    developing nations are currently facing increased pollution levels, others have managed to decrease hazardous
                    substances through effective policies and regulations.
